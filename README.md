Please create a new branch by clicking the dropdown on the left above the list of files, typing a new branch name, and clicking the "create branch: yourname" button. When uploading files please use meaningful titles/descriptions, and also make sure that they are committed to your own branch and **_not the master branch_**.
The master branch is where the combination of all our code is. When you want to add your code to it, click the "New pull request" button, which will allow the code in your branch to be merged with the master branch.

If ever you encounter a bug in the code please go to the "Issues" tab and submit a new issue, making sure to label it as bug. Any other issues such as questions or if you need any help can also be submitted as new issues with the appropriate label.
